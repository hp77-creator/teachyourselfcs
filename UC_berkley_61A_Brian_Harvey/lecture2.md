# Functional Programming - 2

BH told us that this course discusses different paradigms of Computer Science like: Functional Programming, Object Oriented Programming, Declarative, Client-Server, etc.

He also presented an intersting view that our department shouldn't be called Computer Science but rather it should be called as Software Engineering.
He also reminds class that we can't use Software Engineering because
there is already a specialization which has that term
and it focuses on the different styles of making software so we can't use that term also.
He says so about the name because what we are doing is not science as science is about exploration but rather we know 
some set of rules and we are simply following them to 
build new programs.


He then continues from where he left of `piglatin` recursion program and then goes on to tell the difference between function and procedure what is the difference between the two.
