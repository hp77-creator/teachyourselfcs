## Compilers

Compilers are one of the most important thing that one comes across when writing programs. They are a piece of software which translate code from one form to another. Different kinds of form maybe from actual code to machine code, actual code to some other high level interpretation or maybe even something else. It totally depends on the written rules which the compiler follows.

This [Course](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/soe-ycscs1-compilers) goes into detail of different aspects of compilers and these are my notes.
