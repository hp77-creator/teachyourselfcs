## History

The story begins in 1950, when IBM launched 704, customer found that in 704 software costs more than hardware(which already was very expensive compared to today), This lead to increased focus on how can one reduce the software costs.

One of the earliest methods thought was speed coding developed by John Backus. This is basically an early example of Interpreter.

Now what is an Interpreter, an interpreter is basically a software which takes your data and program and gives out output, It can also be said that interpreters do not preprocess or process the program before executing them unlike compilers.

John Backus's idea of speed coding decrease the time taken by the programmer to write programs but it definitely did not process it fast and it also was memory intensive, It took around 30% memory of the total software of the system which was lot and so a new solution had to be found out.

One more issue was that interpreted code were 20-30 times slower than hand written programs, This is also true today for some interpreted languages. 

Because of this things "Speed-Coding" did not become popular but John did get an idea to make things better.

He thought of rather than interpreting formulas like it did in "Speed-Coding" why don't he translate it, Now I am talking about formulas because in those days computers were mostly used for Scientific calculation purposes.

This idea of translating formulas lead to 'FORTRAN' or Formula Translation Project. It was developed between 1954-57 and by 1958 over 50% of programs were written in FORTRAN.

It was a major success considering this higher numbers. FORTRAN had a huge impact on Computer research. Interesting thing about programming languages is that it combines theory and practice in a frutiful way.

FORTRAN influenced a lot in development of compilers so heavy that even today modern compilers preserve the outlines of FORTRAN one.

### Structure of FORTRAN One

- Lexical Analysis 
- Parsing
- Semantic Analysis
- Optimization
- Code Generation

Lexical Analysis and Parsing take care syntactic aspects, Semantic Analysis deals with types and scopes, Code Generation deals with translation.

Let's dive deep in each of them.
