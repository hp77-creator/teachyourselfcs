This is the most exciting of all the course uptill this point(21/09/20, 6:21, UTC+5:30) atleast because this course familiarizes one with all the basic utilities like an editor(Vim), terminal. Then they also teach about various other utilities like git, profiling, debugging and so much more. A must do course for anyone aspiring to be a "CS" grad.
