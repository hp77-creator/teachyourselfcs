## Object-Oriented Design

### Introduction to SDA


Good Design isn't just about code. Having a well thought code design. Saves you from headache later on. Knowledge of SDA will help you will make your software flexible, maintainable and accessible.

Intro to Instructors.

In this Specialization, you will learn how to apply design principles, patterns and architectures to create reusable and flexible software applications and systems.

You will learn how to express in document the design and architecture of a software system using a visual notation.

Disclaimer: Course is not on UI design.
